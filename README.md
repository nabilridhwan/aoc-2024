# Advent of Code 2024

Watch me as I attempt AOC 2024! I will be using Python for all of my solutions. And that's funny because I don't know Python much, never used it in production before. I'm a TS guy. But I'm diving deep into Python for this. So let's see how it goes.

## Why am I doing this?

At this point of time, I have a lot of free time serving my country. I'm torn between using this time to play my instruments, prepare for university math or upgrade my skills in code (and problem solving). This is one of the detour I'm taking to upgrade my skills in code. I'm not sure if I will be able to complete all the puzzles, but I will try my best.

## Puzzle inputs

All puzzle inputs are stored in the `puzzle-inputs` directory. Each day has its own file. I will be reading these files in my solutions.

## Solutions

Solutions are divided by days. Each day has its own directory. Inside the directory, there is a `0X-01.py` and `0X-02.py` file which contains the solution for that day. The X represent the day number and the 1 and 2 represent the stage of that day (i.e. the easier and the harder puzzle).
